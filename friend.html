        <h1>MY FRIENDS</h1>
        <p> Everyone needs a friend,  the good friends they have are the ones who helped shape their lives.
             They can change your life in small or large ways and help you cope with daily your life.
             Sometimes the best friendships are the ones that arenâ€™t expected. Your best friends can be your <strong>amongfamily members, teachers, mentors, or childhood friends</strong>.
             In fact, some friendships are so special that they defy words to describe them.I would say the names of my few friends <strong>Shiva,Swathi,Abijith</strong>.
            as i mentioned above
        <h2>Shiva <h3>collage friend</h3></h2>

<h2>Swathi<h3>ma best friend</h3></h2></p>
